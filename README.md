# Heterogeneous-Parallel-Programming
To perform the most complex problems using Parallel computing i.e.Solving many instruction parallel on GPU with massively multiple threads. Problems like Addition of 1144777 numbers in array, Multiplication of 32 X 32 Dim Matrices are solved using Parallel Computing on GPU.Also, Comparison of time taken and Accuracy to perform same task on CPU and GPU.
